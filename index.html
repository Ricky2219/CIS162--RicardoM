  <p> Engineering is the application of science and mathematics to solve problems.
  	  Engineers figure out how things work and find practical uses for scientific
      discoveries. </p>
      
      <p> <strong> Our Goal:</strong> This wesbite will allow you to deep dive into the world of engineering. Find information on the vast varieties of engineering fields that you find interesting. Look for resources and engineering events near you!    </p>
      
      <p>Scientists and inventors often get the credit for innovations that advance the 
      human condition, but it is engineers who are instrumental in making those innovations.</p><br>

       This newly developed engineering company was the result of two previous engineering services now merging into one. With the addition to the merger, Apexon began the addition of hiring roughly 1,000 individuals to their company. Their mission with the newly expanded circumstances is to better improve both medical technology and health care opportunities. Located in India, they understand the struggle for their individuals to acquire and be able to obtain essential medical products and technologies.

        This interesting "technology" was discovered by Daniel Prestion and Faye Yap. This occured when noticiting the interesting nature of why spiders curl up when they die. They found out that this was due to how the legs work like hydraulic system rather than a muscle-like structure. With the spider being dead it can no longer apply the pressure for its legs to remain straight therefore slowing curling up. Having this information for them, they were now able to modify and use its body to be able to do functions a spider would normally due even if it was dead. While this technology is very specific, some applications are collecting insects due to using a spider as a method of "camoflague" and dealing with microelectronics.

        This article dives into great detail on why there is the struggle of developing large scale 3D printing systems. At first, they used an example of a 4x4x4 3D printer as a reference explaining the measurements with each section of the printer. This is from the nozzel that despenses the plastic fluid to the air compressor that spews the material into the nozzel. All these relative pieces work coherently within the dimensions of the 4x4x4 3D printer. Yet, what this article dives into is that you cannot simply scale everything to its proportional size. There are limitations especially within the nozzel and air compression area that allows the ability to release the material in the same quality and rate as its smaller companion. Therefore, they deep dive into the calculations on the requirements that go into being able to develop a larger scale 3D printer.
